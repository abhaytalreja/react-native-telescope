# react-native-telescope
This is a react native version for Telescope. This project will out of the box support as a reader to Telescope. We will try to make this project as modular as possible.

It is opinionated to make it easy for people to start but if you have your own way of doing things it's very easy to swap things out and move them around however you see fit.

As it currently stands this project is only focused on configuring the React Native project. The Meteor side is completely up to you, you can have a vanila Telescope-Nova instance or something that you have customized. For thoughts on how to structure your Meteor App I would suggest you read the [Meteor Guide](http://guide.meteor.com/) and the [Mantra spec](http://mantrajs.com/).
